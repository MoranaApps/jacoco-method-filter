// NOTE: This example is kept "safe by default": the plugin dependency is commented out so that
// cloning/opening the repo (or running unrelated sbt commands) does not immediately resolve and
// download the published plugin from remote resolvers.
//
// To actually run this example with the published plugin, uncomment the line below.
// (Alternatively, if you're developing this repo, you can `publishLocal` the plugin and point
// your build to the local version.)
//
// See `examples/sbt-basic/README.md` for the recommended workflow.
// addSbtPlugin("io.github.moranaapps" % "jacoco-method-filter-sbt" % "1.2.0")
